# Head Metadata

Docusaurus automatically sets useful page metadata in `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` for you. It is possible to add extra metadata (or override existing ones) with the `<head>` tag in Markdown files:

```md title="markdown-features-head-metadata.mdx"
---
id: head-metadata
title: Head Metadata
---

<!-- highlight-start -->
<head>
  <html className="some-extra-html-class" />
  <body className="other-extra-body-class" />
  <title>Head Metadata customized title!</title>
  <meta charSet="utf-8" />
  <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary" />
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/head-metadata" />
</head>
<!-- highlight-end -->

# Head Metadata

My text
```

```mdx-code-block
<head>
  <html className="some-extra-html-class" />
  <body className="other-extra-body-class" />
  <title>Head Metadata customized title!</title>
  <meta charSet="utf-8" />
  <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary" />
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/head-metadata" />
</head>
```

:::tip

This `<head>` declaration has been added to the current Markdown doc as a demo. Open your browser DevTools and check how this page's metadata has been affected.

:::tip You don't need this for regular SEO

Content plugins (e.g. docs and blog) provide front matter options like `description`, `keywords`, and `image`, which will be automatically applied to both `description` and `og:description`, while you would have to manually declare two metadata tags when using the `<head>` tag.

This feature is built on top of the Docusaurus [`<Head>`](./../../docusaurus-core.md#head) component. Refer to [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) for exhaustive documentation.
